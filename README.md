# Evaluation and subdivision algorithms for general classes of rational bases

In this repository, two application of Matlab are provided. 
A general class of important rational bases can be obtained as a particular example of weighted  $\varphi$-transformed systems.  For these bases, evaluation and subdivision algorithms are presented. 


1. In [App_evaluation_subdivision_general](https://github.com/BeatriazRubio/Article_CAGD_2020/App_evaluation_subdivision/) the application which draw an algorithm of evaluation and subidvision of a general class of rational bases is provided.
2. In [App_evaluation_subdivision](https://github.com/BeatriazRubio/Article_CAGD_2020/App_evaluation_subdivision/) the application which draw an algorithm of evaluation and subidvision of a particular class of rational bases is provided.

The implementation uses Matlab 2020b.
