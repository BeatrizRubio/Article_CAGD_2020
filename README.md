#Evaluation and subdivision algorithms for general classes of rational bases
In this repository, two application of Matlab are provided. 
A general class of important rational bases can be obtained as a particular example of weighted  $\varphi$-transformed systems.  For these bases, evaluation and subdivision algorithms are presented. 


1. In [Experiments_table](https://github.com/Cimagroup/Curve-approximation-based-on-Neural-Networks-forgeneral-classes-of-totally-positive-rational-bases/tree/main/Experiments_table) the code for Table 1 is provided.
2. The architecture and training implementation is described in the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Cimagroup/Curve-approximation-based-on-Neural-Networks-forgeneral-classes-of-totally-positive-rational-bases/blob/main/Neural%20network%20implementation.ipynb). (Can be seen in markdown version [here](https://github.com/Cimagroup/Curve-approximation-based-on-Neural-Networks-forgeneral-classes-of-totally-positive-rational-bases/blob/main/Neural%20network%20implementation/Neural%20network%20implementation.md)).

The implementation uses Tensorflow 2.0.
