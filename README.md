Evaluation and subdivision algorithms for general classes of rational bases
In this repository, two application of Matlab are provided. 
A general class of important rational bases can be obtained as a particular example of weighted  $\varphi$-transformed systems.  For these bases, evaluation and subdivision algorithms are presented. 

The implementation uses Matlab 2020b.
